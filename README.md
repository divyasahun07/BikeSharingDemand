# Bike-Sharing Demand Prediction ðŸš²

This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning project developed during my internship at 1Stop. The project focuses on predicting bike-sharing demand using historical data and advanced machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to accurately forecast bike demand based on various factors like weather, seasonality, and time. This helps optimize bike availability and enhances user experience in bike-sharing systems.

## Features
- Data pre-processing and exploratory data analysis.
- Feature engineering to extract meaningful insights.
- Development and evaluation of machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
- Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization.
- Visualization of results and insights.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **IDE**: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## Dataset
The dataset used includes features like:
- Date and time
- Weather conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity)
- Holiday and weekend indicators
- Historical bike rental counts

## Key Outcomes
- Achieved an accurate demand forecasting model with significant performance metrics.
- Identified key factors influencing bike-sharing demand.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/bike-sharing-demand.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook bike_sharing_demand.ipynb
   ```

## Results
- Visualization of demand trends over time.
- Detailed performance metrics (e.g., RÂ² score, RMSE).
- Deployment-ready predictive model.

## Future Scope
- Integration with real-time bike-sharing data for live predictions.
- Deployment of the model as a web service using Flask or FastAPI.

## Acknowledgments
This project was part of my internship at 1Stop. I extend my gratitude to my mentors and the team for their guidance and support.
